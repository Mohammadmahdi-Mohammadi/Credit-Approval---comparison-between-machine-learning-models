# Credit-Approval---comparison-between-machine-learning-models
In this problem, we were hoping you could study the given dataset related to credit card approval.

a) Load the dataset, apply the needed preprocessing steps(missing values, normalization, outlier detection using K-Means, etc.), and split the dataset to train and test sets(15:85).

b) Try to train a K-NN as the classifier. Evaluate your result using the confusion matrix and recall, precision, and accuracy. Find the best K hyperparameter with the Elbow technique

c) Try to train a Decision Tree as the classifier. Evaluate your result using the confusion matrix and recall, precision, and accuracy. Use cross-validation.

d) Try to train a Random Forest as the classifier. Evaluate your result using the confusion matrix and recall, precision, and accuracy. Use grid search. How much does it take to find and train a model? is it worth it?

e) Try to train a Gaussian Naive Bayes(GBN) as the classifier. Evaluate your result using the confusion matrix and recall, precision, and accuracy.

f) Try to train a Logistic Regression as the classifier. Evaluate your result using the confusion matrix and recall, precision, and accuracy.

g) Try to train an SVM as the classifier. Evaluate your result using the confusion matrix and recall, precision, and accuracy. Try to find the optimal kernels and parameters.

h) Try to train an AdaBoost as the classifier. Evaluate your result using the confusion matrix and recall, precision, and accuracy.

i) Try to train K-Means as the clustering algorithm, cluster the dataset into two part, and use it for classification. Evaluate your result using the confusion matrix and recall, precision, and accuracy.

j) Create a table for all results you obtained. Your columns will be: FN, FP, accuracy, precision, F1 score, recall, training time(ms), predicting time(ms-how much it takes that model to predict a single sample)
Compare the results and discuss. Which one is the better choice for the given task and based on which metric? Why? Justify your answer.

k) Modify the best trained model in previous part to enhance your mentioned metric.
